1) Hospitals will be required to provide up front a menu of prices for services to be rendered. Ranges of prices will be allowed for procedures/diagnostics with a reasonably probable variance of price, such as surgical procedures. Up front pricing for emergency services rendered will not be required, however hospitals will be required to make publically available average cost information for these services.
(This proposal will help reduce cost for services by making pricing data publically available and encouraging consumers to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare purchases. This will allow the market to pressure healthcare providers to keep costs and pricing down to remain competitive.)
